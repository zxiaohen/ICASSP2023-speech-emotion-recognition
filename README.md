This is a repository for our work: A DUAL ATTENTION-BASED MODALITY-COLLABORATIVE FUSION NETWORK FOR EMOTION RECOGNITION
Multi-modal emotion recognition (MER) is an emerging research field in human-computer interactions. However, previous studies have explored several fusion methods to deal with the asynchronism and the heterogeneity of multimodal data but they mostly neglect the importance of discriminative unimodal information  resulting in the ignorance of independence of uni-modality. Furthermore, the complementarity among different fusion strategies is seldom taken in consideration. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-collaborative fusion network (MCFN) consisting of three main components: a dual attention-based intra-modal learning module which is devoted to build the initial embedding spaces, a modality-collaborative learning approach is to reconcile the emotional information across modalities, and a two-stage fusion strategy to integrate multimodal features which are improved by a mutual adjustment approach. 
The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in overall experiments on two well-known public datasets.
